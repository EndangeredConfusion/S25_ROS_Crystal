Task 3 involves using one of multiple ways to draw a black square using turtlesim.
One such procedure is described below.

One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to use the keyboard inputs, provided by
 the turtle_teleop_key node as normal.

Upon starting up turtlesim_node with the turtle at the center of the window, the
 turtle_teleop_key can be run to initiate keyboard inputs for the turtle. In addition
 to the directional arrow keys that control forwards and backward movement and arbitrary
 left and right rotations, the alphaneumerical keys that surround F can be used to make more
 precise rotations.

Before movement can be made, the path made by the turtle must change. To change the color of
 the line drawn by the turtle, the command:

	ros2 service call /turtle1/set_pen turtlesim/srv/SetPen "{width: 5}"

 ...can be called. This means the service SetPen is being called and manually altered using
 the YAML data format. Because no colors are being set with this call, and only width is
 (just to make the box appear clearer on the blue background of turtlesim), turtlesim
 defaults to coloring the path to Black

Drawing the square using the turtle_teleop_key node follows this sequence:
  1. Turn left using D
  2. Move forward
  3. Turn down using V
  4. Move forward
  5. Turn right using G
  6. Move forward
  7. Turn up using R
  8. Move forward

The black square should be drawn
